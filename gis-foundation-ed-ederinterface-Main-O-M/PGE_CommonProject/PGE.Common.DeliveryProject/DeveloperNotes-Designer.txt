The configuration file should be installed by the installer and the installer should also write a registry key for PGE.Common.Delivery.CodeLibrary's install location.
The EDMConfiguration class uses this registry key setting to find the location of EDM config file.
If the dll is installed by custom installer,add the registry key HKEY/LocalMachine/Software/Telvent/Utility during install and add a string key called EDMConfigLocation and set its value to the install location of the dll.
